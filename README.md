This cli tool can be used to download old (and therefore unsupported) versions of chromium.

## Disclaimer üî•

Reasons to use this tool:

* Verify that bugs that look browser-version-related, really are.

Reasons to NOT use this tool:

* Reobtain removed functionality in Chrome(-ium)

To be explicit:

**‚ö†Ô∏è The downloaded versions are *OUTDATED* and *UNSUPPORTED*! Some known and exploitable bugs, that are already fixed on newer versions, still exist. That's why new versions were released! Use this only for debugging purposes for websites YOU CONTROL! NEVER use these versions for browsing! NEVER EVER enter private data in these browser versions and NEVER EVER login to accounts with these browser versions!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## Installation

#### via npm

```
npm install -g rusted-chromium
rusted-chromium --help
```

#### via github

```
git clone https://github.com/BuZZ-T/rusted-chromium
cd rusted-chromium

```

## All available flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|-
| `--max`| `-M` | 10000 | Maximum version which should be selectable
| `--min`| `-m` | 0 | Minimum version which should be selectable
| `--max-results`| `-r` | 10 | Maximum number of results to select. Directly downloads the binary, if set to 1
| `--os`| `-o` | The operation system on the current system | Set the operation system of the binary. Valid values are "win", "linux" and "mac"/"darwin".
| `--arch`| `-a` | The architecture on the current system | Set the architecture of the binary. The flag is only regarded, if `--os` is present. Valid values are "x86" and "x64". "x86" is ignored for "mac".
| `--unzip` | `-z` | false | Directly unzip the downloaded zip-file and delete the .zip afterwards
| `--decreaseOnFail`| `-d` | false | Automatically try the next lower version, if the selected version has no binary
| `--increaseOnFail`| `-i` | false | Automatically try the next higher version, if the selected version has no binary
|`--non-interactive` | `-n` | false | Don't display the version selection. Automatically select the newest version in the available range (set by `--min`, `--max` and `--max-results`). Only works when `--decreaseOnFail` is set as well.
| `--version`| `-V` | - | Show current version
| `--help`| `-h` | - | Display a help with all available flags

## Examples

##### Define a minimum and maximum major version
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --min 60 --max 70
# short version
rusted-chromium -m 60 -M 70
```
##### Define a maximum major/minor version
*NOTE: Currently makes no sense, as the minor version is always "0".*
```bash
rusted-chromium --max 70.0
```

##### Define a maximum major/minor/branch version
```bash
rusted-chromium --max 70.0.3539
```
##### Define a maximum major/minor/branch/patch version
```bash
rusted-chromium --max 70.0.3539.100
```

##### Define a maximum version and an amount of results
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --max 70 --max-results 30
# short version
rusted-chromium -M 70 -r 30
```

##### Directly download the version without interactive selection
*NOTE: This supports `--max` `--min` as well!*
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --max-results 1
# short version
rusted-chromium -r 1
```

##### Automatically unzip the downloaded archive
*NOTE: This is using `unzipper` which loses executable flags for binaries*
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --unzip
# short version
rusted-chromium -z
```

##### Automatically try the next lower version, if the selected version has no binary
*NOTE: This regards `--min`, `--max` and `--max-results`*
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --max=30 --decreaseOnFail
# short version
rusted-chromium --max=30 -d
```

##### Automatically try the next higher version, if the selected version has no binary
*NOTE: This regards `--min`, `--max` and `--max-results`*
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --max=30 --increaseOnFail
# short version
rusted-chromium -M 30 -i
```

##### Automatically select the newest of 7 results and automatically try the next lower version, if the tried version has no binary
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --max 78 --max 79.0.3909.0 --max-results 7 -d --non-interactive
# short version
rusted-chromium -M 79.0.3909.0 -r 7 -d -n
```

##### Show the help and quit
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --help
# short version
rusted-chromium -h
```

##### Show the version and quit
```bash
# long version
rusted-chromium --version
# short version
rusted-chromium -V
```
## FAQ

### Can i contribute?
I'm accepting pull requests and feature requests (no guarantee that i will implement this fast or implement this at all, but feel free to ask).

### Do you build chromium versions? Do you store chromium binaries/archives? Do you have your own chromium repository?

NO, NO and NO. This CLI basically automates the manual steps mentioned in https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium in the section "Downloading old builds of Chrome / Chromium".
So only official chromium APIs are called and only official binaries are downloaded.

So, this project:

* has **NO own repository** for chromium sources
* **does not build** versions of chromium itself
* **does not store** binaries or archives of chromium
